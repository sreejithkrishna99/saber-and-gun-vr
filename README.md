# Saber & Gun VR 🎮  

A unique twist on the classic Beat Saber — one hand wields a **lightsaber**, the other a **blaster**.  
Created as part of my **VR Game Development coursework**.

- Dual-wield gameplay: slice blocks with your saber or shoot them with your gun  
- Dynamic block patterns synchronized with music  
- Optimized for Meta Quest / Oculus VR  
- Built using **Unity3D** and **XR Interaction Toolkit**

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

You’ll use:  
- 🟦 **Left Hand:** Lightsaber to slash incoming blocks  
- 🟥 **Right Hand:** Gun to shoot distant targets  

Timing and rhythm are key — hit or shoot to the beat for the highest score!  
Combining melee precision with ranged shooting offers a whole new rhythm-combat experience.

## 🧠 Game Concept

This project reimagines rhythm-based VR gameplay by combining two mechanics:  
**swordplay** and **shooting**. It challenges **coordination**, **rhythm**, and **reflexes**, giving players a fast-paced, high-intensity experience.

> Developed as part of my VR course project, this prototype demonstrates **real-time physics**, **collision detection**, **haptic feedback**, and **music synchronization**.
